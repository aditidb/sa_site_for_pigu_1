# First site made Amar for Ratale

1. This the old site that I have made for Ratale at that time
2. I have used here literally inline css and also not use meta tag
   and all in head
3. I was using sublime at that time and was use to write each tag
   with hand it was nice experience
4. At that time I was not familiar with directories and all so I was
   not able to render photos an alternative to that I use issues
   that is part of github that is not possible in windows 11
   because drag and drop is some how restricted in windows 11

## Appendix

To keep record of code what I have made and what code was
actually made by me I have kept the another file as it and all
the code is same just add some things in head tag to to remove that
popup of install extension the file name of original file is conde_28_07_2021.html
it is in the same directory
